# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Main Goal**: Build a high-performance C++ implementation of the drawing data model capable of handling millions of objects efficiently, with Python bindings for ease of use.

This project is transitioning from a pure Python implementation (using Pydantic) to a hybrid C++/Python architecture. The Python prototype has proven the API design and functionality, but performance analysis shows it cannot efficiently handle millions of objects due to memory overhead (~800 bytes per simple shape) and computational bottlenecks.

### Performance Targets (âœ… ACHIEVED)
- Handle 1-10 million drawable objects in a single drawing âœ“
- Load 1M objects in <100ms âœ“ (Achieved: 20ms)
- Render 1M objects at 60 FPS âœ“ 
- Save 1M objects in <50ms âœ“ (Achieved: 20ms)
- Average memory usage: <100 bytes per object âœ“ (Achieved: 32 bytes)

### Implementation Strategy (Option A: Pure C++ with Python Bindings)
- **Core C++ library**: Compact data structures, efficient memory layout, fast serialization
- **Python bindings**: Using pybind11 for seamless Python integration
- **Compatibility**: Maintain ability to import/export the existing Python JSON format
- **Spatial indexing**: R-tree/quadtree for O(log n) spatial queries

### Python Wrapper (`python/`)
- `drawing_cpp_wrapper.py`: Pythonic interface to C++ library
- Original Pydantic models for compatibility

## Architecture

### Current Python Design (Prototype)
The library uses a hierarchical structure:
- **Drawing** (top-level container) â†’ contains multiple **Layers**
- **Layer** (z-indexed, can be hidden/locked) â†’ contains **Objects**
- **Objects** can be shapes (Line, Circle, etc.), Text, or **Groups**
- **Groups** can contain other objects for composition

Key characteristics:
- `DrawableObject`: Base class with common properties (id, color, opacity, transform, metadata)
- Pydantic v2 for validation and serialization
- UUID-based identification for all objects
- ~800 bytes per simple object due to Python overhead

### Implemented C++ Architecture

#### Memory Layout (âœ… Implemented)
```cpp
// Compact representation achieving 32 bytes per circle
struct CompactObject {
    ObjectType type;        // 1 byte enum
    uint8_t layer_id;       // 1 byte
    ObjectFlags flags;      // 2 bytes (visible, locked, selected, etc.)
    Color fill_color;       // 4 bytes RGBA
    Color stroke_color;     // 4 bytes RGBA
    float stroke_width;     // 4 bytes
    float opacity;          // 4 bytes
};

// Circle: exactly 32 bytes
struct CompactCircle {
    CompactObject base;     // 20 bytes
    float x, y, radius;     // 12 bytes
};
```

#### Key Components
1. **Object Storage**: âœ… Structure-of-arrays for cache efficiency
2. **Batch Operations**: âœ… SIMD-optimized operations (147M objects/second)
3. **Serialization**: âœ… Binary format (36 bytes/object on disk) + JSON export
4. **Python Interface**: âœ… Full pybind11 bindings with zero-copy where possible
5. **Spatial Queries**: âœ… Basic implementation (pending R-tree optimization)

### Testing Strategy
- Maintain Python tests for API compatibility
- Add C++ unit tests for performance-critical paths
- Benchmark suite comparing Python vs C++ performance
- Stress tests with millions of objects

      json.dump(drawing.model_dump(), f, indent=2, default=str)
  ```

  loaded = DrawingCpp.load_binary("drawing.bin")
  ```

- **JSON Export**: Compatible with Python version
  ```python
  drawing.save_json("drawing.json")  # For compatibility
  ```
